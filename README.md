An analysis of Olist's consumer base reveals that its customers are spread across all states of Brazil, with a higher concentration in the densely populated and economically developed states along the southeastern coast. Notably, the state of Sao Paulo boasts the largest number of Olist users. Furthermore, Olist's customer profile indicates that they tend to belong to the upper middle income bracket.

Recommendations

The majority of Olist users prefer to purchase essential items such as bedding, healthcare products, sports equipment, and computer accessories. In contrast, customers residing in the southeastern coast region are primarily interested in purchasing health and beauty products, alongside souvenir items catering to the tourism industry.

Recommendations
- Develop a premium service brand for long-lasting consumer products.
- Enhance corporate image, and entice prospective customers.

# 4. Payment & Orders Analysis
![alt text](https://github.com/jennywong2023/Olist-Project/blob/main/4.%20Orders%20Analysis.jpeg)

Most purchases occur on weekdays during specific timeframes: 10:00 am to 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm. The total expenditure per user is concentrated at lower levels, with orders ranging between below $100 and $500. Furthermore, the majority of orders consist of a single product purchase. Overall, Olist's orders reflect a low-frequency and small-amount consumption pattern. Customers tend to make only one purchase and exhibit low levels of loyalty.

Recommendations
- The strategy for limited offers is to focus on weekdays when there is typically higher spending activity. By doing so, we can maximize the potential of offers and generate revenue for Olist.
- Prioritizing the selling of high-value products. Increase revenue and position Olist as a provider of premium products, further enhancing our brand reputation.
- Enhance consumer loyalty to maintain and grow Olist's business.

Regarding customer payments, credit card transactions represent the primary payment method, accounting for over 70% of total transactions. This data reflects a high level of confidence among consumers in the financial system.

Continuing with credit card payments, the number of installments chosen by customers reflects their ability to consume, and as the value of orders increases, the payment period for installments should also increase accordingly. However, the data indicates that when the number of installments increases, the value of orders tends to decrease, indicating that our customers' purchasing power may not be sufficient.

On the other hand, Boleto payments account for almost 20% of total transactions. Boleto is one of the largest payment service providers in Brazil and has the potential to improve its market share.

In addition, we have observed that customers can use a large number of vouchers in a single order, with some orders having 19 or more vouchers applied, indicating that customers can use vouchers to fully or partially offset the order value without any limit.

Recommendations

- Negotiate with credit card platforms and Boleto to explore potential partnerships or incentives that can encourage customers to use these payment methods more frequently. This could help to diversify our payment options and reduce our reliance on a single payment method.

- Implement an upper limit on voucher usage to avoid excessive discounts that could negatively impact our profitability. This limit can be set based on the average number of vouchers used per order or a fixed percentage of the order value.

- By taking these actions, we can optimize our payment options and improve our profitability while maintaining a positive customer experience.

We have observed a trend in the maximum and minimum payment values in times of credit card installments, which may indicate that customers are more cautious when making larger purchases with installments. This trend should be monitored closely to identify any potential issues or opportunities for improvement.

The top 5 categories in terms of sum of price are health and beauty, watch and gifts, bed bath table, sports and leisure, toys and coumputers accessories. These categories are popular among our customers and represent a significant portion of our sales.

Top 5 categories with the most sales volume are the top 10 categories with the largest number of commodities. It can be seen that the number of commodity types is related to sales performance. Additionally, it is worth noting that each combo set typically includes two items from similar product categories.

Recommendation

Recommendations:
